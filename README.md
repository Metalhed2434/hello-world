# hello-world
I guess I am just saying hello?

Hello everyone, my name is Tyson and I am just another newb trying to learn how to code.  I am not sure exactly which path I would like to take and have been dipping my toes in several different coding languages.  I am hoping to attain some marketable skills with which I can use to make more money!  Everybody likes money.....
